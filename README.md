Yiays.com is my main website, featuring a simple blog, a list of projects and services, and a general showcase of my web development skills.

## Structure

All page requests go through `router.php`. Pages use `includes/header.php` and `includes/footer.php` to give the website a consistent appearance, behaviour, and navigation.

Authentication is handled by [Passport](https://github.com/yiays/passport).
