**Hi, I'm Yiays, the sole developer of ConfessionBot, merely, MemeDB, and this blog. I build and maintain a bunch of** [**Discord Bots, Websites, games, and tools**](/projects/) **- hosting them at cost from home.**

I'm a graduate with a degree in IT _(majoring in Information Systems, for those curious)_ and work on these things in my spare time, I delve deep into every aspect of Information Technology because I enjoy just about every aspect of it, from servers, networking, programming, database, web, security, you name it - I've probably learned it and used it to help bring my projects to life without having to depend on others or pay for their services.

Outside of my development work I'm an enthusiast of computer building, Linux, 3D printing, VR / rhythm / simulation / puzzle games, solar power, right-to-repair, I believe in the freedom and preservation of information.

Almost everything I build is [open source](https://github.com/yiays) so others can learn from it, audit it, and possibly even contribute to it. This is also a good way to keep an automatically updating portfolio of work for employers.

I primarily use Windows on my personal machines, but all of my services run on a Linux server I maintain myself. Please consider [supporting me](https://patreon.com/yiays) to help keep my services live.

If you share any of my interests, you should check back on this blog every now and then. I aim to create thoroughly written documentation of my experiences at least twice a year.
