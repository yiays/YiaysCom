### Settings

#### Channel Types

![](https://cdn.yiays.com/blog/cb-channels.webp)

There are 4 anonymous channel types. Set any channel to any of them using `/set`.

*   **üëÅÔ∏è Traceable:** Anon-IDs will appear next to each confession, these stay the same for each person until someone uses `/shuffle`.
*   **üôà Untraceable:** Anon-IDs will only appear in a vetting channel (if you have one set). This reduces the chances of users being identified but also makes moderation and conversation more difficult.
*   **üì£ Feedback:** Anyone can send messages here, even if they can't see the channel. Good for an anonymous tip, or something similar.
*   **ü§î Vetting:** These channels don't accept anonymous messages directly, but instead intercept them and ask moderators if they should be allowed to be posted publicly.

#### Image support

Images are supported alongside text by default, this can be disabled using `/imagesupport disable`.

#### Moderation

![](https://cdn.yiays.com/blog/cb-moderation.webp)

Anyone with moderator permissions can block users from sending anonymous messages with `/block`, shuffle anon-ids with `/shuffle`, or approve and deny messages in vetting.

If you want to give other users these powers without making them a moderator `/botmod` them.
