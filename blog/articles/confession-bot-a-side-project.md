### Settings

#### Channel Types

![](https://cdn.yiays.com/blog/cb-setup.webp)

There are 4 anonymous channel types. Set any channel to any of them using `/set`.

*   **ðŸ’¬ Anonymous:** Anyone that can see this channel can send anonymous messages here.
    *   This is the standard experience.
*   **ðŸ“£ Feedback:** All member of the server can send messages here, even if they can't see the channel using `/confess-to`, or by confessing to an unset channel.
    *   Good for anonymous tips, requests, or something similar.
*   **ðŸ¤” Vetting:** These channels intercept anonymous messages headed to any other channel; a moderator must approve each message before they are sent.
    *   This effectively blocks all anonymous spam, harassment, and other attention-grabbing behaviour. _Highly recommended._
*   ðŸ›’ **Marketplace:** Messages require more information, like a price, payment methods, and a description before they are sent here. Offers can be sent and accepted anonymously.
    *   This is an experimental channel type which requires a custom bot to use. Anonymity is ended once a buyer and a seller agree on a price, their usernames are shared with each other.

In addition, Anon-IDs can be toggled on or off for most of these channel types using the Traceable toggle.

*   ðŸŸ¢**AnonIDs: Shown:** Each message will start with a (cryptographically secure) 6-character string and a colour. For example `Anon-fbd872`.
    *   Naturally, users might eventually notice patterns emerging from one Anon-ID, and they may start to make guesses as to who they are. Use `/shuffle` to change all Anon-IDs on your server in order to continue protecting the privacy of your users.
*   ðŸ”´**AnonIDs: Hidden:** No colour or string will appear next to messages, users will be indistinguishable from one another.
    *   Blocking Anon-IDs is more difficult when they are hidden, but they _are_ still recoverable. You will need to [join the support server](https://discord.gg/wfKx24kDUR) in order to get help with this.

#### Image support

![](https://cdn.yiays.com/blog/cb-imagesupport.webp)

Images are supported alongside text by default, this can be disabled using `/controlpanel` and clicking on ðŸŸ¢ _Image Support: True_.

#### Moderation

![](https://cdn.yiays.com/blog/cb-moderation.webp)

Anyone with moderator permissions can block users from sending anonymous messages with `/block`, shuffle anon-ids with `/shuffle`, or approve and deny messages in vetting.

If you want to give other users these powers without making them a moderator, change the command permissions in your server settings.

### Privacy policy

_ConfessionBot promises users confidentiality like that you'd find with a doctor or therapist._ Only breaching user's privacy when there is good reason to be concerned about somebody's wellbeing.
